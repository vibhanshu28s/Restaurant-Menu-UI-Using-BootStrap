This menu interface was created using Bootstrap, leveraging its responsive grid system and utility classes to design a modern restaurant menu with visually organised sections. Each food category is cleanly separated with headings, accompanying images, and price lists, making for a user-friendly browsing and ordering experience. Bootstrap’s flexible layout components helped align menu items and images effectively across devices, ensuring clarity and accessibility in presentation.
